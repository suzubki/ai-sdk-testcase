React hooks are a powerful feature that let you use state and other React features without writing classes. Here are some tips for using them effectively:

## Rules of Hooks

1. **Only call hooks at the top level** of your component or custom hooks
2. **Don't call hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions**

## Common Hooks

- **useState**: For local component state
- **useEffect**: For side effects like data fetching
- **useContext**: For consuming context
- **useReducer**: For complex state logic
- **useCallback**: For memoizing functions
- **useMemo**: For memoizing values

## Example of useState and useEffect

\`\`\`jsx
function ProfilePage({ userId }) {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // This runs after render and when userId changes
    fetchUser(userId).then(userData => {
      setUser(userData);
    });
  }, [userId]);

  return user ? <Profile user={user} /> : <Loading />;
}

The useCallback hook is used to memoize functions to prevent unnecessary re-renders of child components that receive functions as props.

The useMemo hook is used to memoize values to avoid expensive recalculations on every render.

Both hooks help with performance optimization, but they serve different purposes.`,

        content: `## useCallback vs useMemo

Both hooks help with performance optimization, but they serve different purposes:

### useCallback

\`useCallback\` memoizes **functions** to prevent unnecessary re-renders of child components that receive functions as props.

\`\`\`jsx
// Without useCallback - a new function is created on every render
const handleClick = () => {
  console.log(count);
};

// With useCallback - the function is only recreated when dependencies change
const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
  console.log(count);
}, [count]);
\`\`\`

### useMemo

\`useMemo\` memoizes **values** to avoid expensive recalculations on every render.

\`\`\`jsx
// Without useMemo - expensive calculation runs on every render
const sortedList = expensiveSort(items);

// With useMemo - calculation only runs when items change
const sortedList = useMemo(() => expensiveSort(items), [items]);
\`\`\`

### When to use which?

- Use **useCallback** when:
  - Passing callbacks to optimized child components that rely on reference equality
  - Working with event handlers that you pass to child components

- Use **useMemo** when:
  - You have computationally expensive calculations
  - You want to avoid recreating objects that are used as dependencies for other hooks

### Performance Note

Don't overuse these hooks! They come with their own overhead. Only use them when you have identified a genuine performance issue.`,
